                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>I was born in Micho√†can, Mexico. I came to the United States at the age of 5. Growing up, I faced a lot of struggles, from learning a whole 
                      new language. I made a lot of mistakes in the past, but it as made me a better person and I have learned from those experiences. I never gave up on achieving my career goals and I 
                     can not wait to see what the future holds for me. </p>
                    <p> I was apart of the Road to Hire tech program. A non-profit organization that helps young adults achieve their goals regardless of their background.
                        Throughout the program, I have not only learned coding languages but, also professional development skills. I'm excited to continue learning and my future as a web 
                        developer.
