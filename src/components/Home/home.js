                I started Road to Hire in June 18, 2018. I had to go through the gateway program, which determined if I got in to the actual program. 
                This program is a huge opportunity, I still can not believe I got the chance to be apart of. This program has not only taught me programmimg 
                languages but also skills that I will use throughout my developer career. I still have of a improvement in both the professional and coding aspect. 
                I can not wait to start learning many more programming languages.
